This document discusses the storing of multiprecision values in the LARC
MatrixStore.
========================================================================

To begin, one should consider the precision of the scalarType chosen when LARC
is complied, as any excess precision in the data to be stored will be lost.
MPInteger, MPRational and MPRatComplex types will allocate whatever memory is
needed to exactly represent the number given to them. In contrast, MPReal is
limited (by the current setting of the mpfr_prec_t constant mpreal_precision in
global.c) to 256 bits of mantissa precision, and MPComplex to 256 bits of
mantissa for each of its real and imaginary parts. Integer scalarType has 64
bits of precision, and Real scalarType is C long double, with precision for
mantissa and exponent that depends on your platform (but should be at least 64
bits total).

If you already have your multiprecision value in string form, then you can
simply call the LARC routine
	get_valID_from_valString
from either C or Python to load the value into the MatrixStore. However, for
complex types, the data must be in the format "a+I*b" for the conversions to
work properly, so it may be necessary to reformat your string before calling
this routine.

If you need to calculate the value, there are somewhat different procedures
depending on whether you are using C or Python.

1) C code

Example code can be found in LARC's global.c routine, where the value 1/sqrt(2)
is preloaded into LARC's MatrixStore. The value is calculated using floating
point arithmetic with {\tt mpreal_precision} bits of precision and then
converted to a LARC scalarType. Note that once the value is converted to
scalarType, we free the memory from the temporary mpfr_t variable. In most
cases we will also want to free the memory of the scalarType variable once the
value is in the MatrixStore.

It is necessary for your code to have access to the MPFR and (if complex) MPC
libraries, so you will need the include statements
	#include <mpfr.h>
	#include <mpc.h>
You will of course also need access to the LARC library, minimally through
	#include "larc.h"
	#include "scalars.h"

The first step is calculation of your scalar value using the MPFR or MPC
library. Once this is done, a call to
	convert_from_mpfr_to_scalarType
for real values (scalarType may be complex) or
	convert_from_two_mpfr_to_complex_scalarType
for complex values will generate the appropriate scalarType value. Finally,
	get_valMatPTR_from_val 
will load the scalarType value into LARC's MatrixStore.

2) Python code

We only allow data in string form to pass through the SWIG interface between
Python and LARC's C code, so all multiprecision data must first be converted to
a string.

We assume LARC is accessed via
	import pylarc
(if not, replace "pylarc" below with the name you have chosen). Access to the
MPFR and MPC multiprecision libraries is provided through
	import gmpy2

Use the gmpy2 library functions to calculate your multiprecision value and 
convert it to a string. (Note that a value returned by mpc_get_str needs
further editing. If your complex value is a+ib, mpc_get_str returns "(a b)";
for LARC to understand the input, you must convert it to the string "a+I*b".)
Once you have the value in string format, 
	pylarc.get_valID_from_valString
will convert it to a scalarType and load it into the MatrixStore.
