BUG FIXES:

 * updated calls to LARCmatrix write routines to use new versions.
 * updated Tutorial functions using InfoStore to call correct LARC routines
 * fixed format of complex constants in src/sycamore.c
 * Makefile now creates MyPyLARC/lib directory if it does not exist.
 * Makefile now links ncurses library rather than curses library.

IMPROVEMENTS:
 * updated Juypter notebook that creates LARC matrix compression graph.
 * updated names of LARC functions to names for LARC version 2.1.
 * no longer use functions that have matrix pointers as arguments, instead use
   functions depending on packedIDs.
 * updated Tutorial functions to work with additional scalarTypes
 * updated Tutorial functions to indicated when they don't work with certain
   scalarTypes, and to exit if MyPyLARC is compiled in those scalarTypes
 * updated Tutorial functions to indicate that they might work poorly with
   rational scalarTypes and to give user option to abort if MyPyLARC is
   compiled with those scalarTypes

ADDITIONS:
 * expanded Sycamore_play project: added README.txt, sycamore_config.json,
   sycamore_generate.py, numpy_run.py and sycamore_run.py 
 * added list of LARC functions to Tutorial directory
