We suggest that you leave default.init_params unmodified
and instead copy it to a file <myapp>.init_params that
you can modify for your application.

You can also use the program write_init_param_file.py to
create your param file (then edit as you like), with a
command such as
   python3 write_init_param_file.py my_app.init_params
