The MyPyLARC package is intended to provide practical examples of how one
might use the LARC matrix mathematics package.
There is a small amount of C and Python code in the MyPyLARC/src directory
which is used by certain projects, but almost all of the computational work
is performed by LARC C code. Most, if not all, of the LARC routines relating
to matrix math functions are on <A HREF="../larc/html/matmath_8h.html">this
page</A>. If you do not see what you are looking for there, the main page
for LARC documentation can be found
<A HREF="../larc/html/index.html">here</A>.

The Tutorials subdirectory
contains a selection of Tutorial routines which introduce the conceptual
design for LARC and certain practical aspects of its use.

The InitParams subdirectory contains a selection of suitable parameters for
initializing LARC, and also a program which writes a parameter file to disk.

Other subdirectories contain several "projects" which are intended to
demonstrate how one might use LARC to solve
specific problems. Each project directory contains a README describing the
problem and (usually) Python code which performs the tasks of initializing
LARC and performing the necessary mathematics.
